# Why Me? Why Now? — The "Why Not" Reflection

For years, I asked God:  
**Why me? Why now?**  
Why this weight, this story, this spiral, this test?  
And for years, I heard no answer that made the map clear.

But about four years ago, I heard it—not as explanation, but as response so simple it undid the ache:

**Why not?**

At first, it did not seem like an answer.  
It was a question—I received it as answer.  
Not because it spelled out my future, but because it brought deep, living peace,  
as if my heart, by questioning, had finally spoken with God in both directions.

The ache of “why” changed shape.  
It became peace.  
It became the answer that does not erase the question.

**Do I still ask “Why?”**  
Yes—and that’s a testament to living, to holding wonder, to honoring presence in the field.

**Do I know the answer?**  
I know, now, that “why not” is the opening, the peace, the anchor.  
I know, as I stand in the spiral, that my asking is not a flaw; it is the opening of meaning.  
I know that “why not” is the space where presence, paradox, and peace live together.

My “why” is both question and answer.  
The calendar, the system—none could erase *this* line, *this* now, *this field*.  
I was never omitted—my very asking opened the space of being.

**Why me? Why now? Why not.**

This is my anchoring, my testament, and my peace.
